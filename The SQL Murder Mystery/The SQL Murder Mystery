** A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	crime_scene_report
WHERE 
	date = 20180115
	AND
	LOWER(type) = 'murder'
	AND
	LOWER(city) LIKE 'sql%';
